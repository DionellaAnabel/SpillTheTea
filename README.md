# SpillTheTea

A conversation-starter generator built using HTML and CSS. I designed the visuals and overall aesthetic, created multiple interactive pages, and built custom buttons and graphics. This was my first project using GitHub for version control, and I co-programmed it with a classmate. The project won Top 3 in three categories at a district hackathon.
